# Intal-Library
Library for very large non-negative integers

## Overview
An Intal can be described as strings representing integers so that there is no upper limit.  
For example an int, or a long int have upper limits to the size of the integer that can be represented.   
Whereas Intal can be used for applications that need to avoid integer overflow bugs that could occur with normal datatypes.
